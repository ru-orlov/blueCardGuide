        <h2>Who can apply for a blue card?</h2>
        <p>Employers, volunteer coordinators and education providers are responsible for applying for blue cards on behalf of their employees, volunteers or trainee students. Business operators or people seeking to operate a business working with children are responsible for applying directly to Blue Card Services for a blue card. However, if you have had your blue card suspended, are a negative notice holder or a disqualified person, you are unable to apply for a blue card and should contact Blue Card Services for further information.</p>
		</br>
		
		<h2>What is the blue card check?</h2>
		<p>The blue card check assesses:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> national criminal history, of all charges and convictions (including spent and not recorded)</li>
			<li> child protection prohibition orders (whether a person is a respondent or subject to an application)</li>
			<li> disqualification orders</li>
			<li> if a person is subject to reporting obligations under the Child Protection (Offender Reporting) Act 2004 or Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003</li>
			<li> disciplinary information held by certain professional organisations including teachers, child care providers and foster carers </li>
			<li>information that the Police Commissioner may provide in relation to police investigations into allegations of serious	child-related sexual offences, even if no charges were laid.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>A person whose application is approved is issued with a positive notice letter and a blue card. If a person’s application is refused, they are issued with a negative notice which prohibits them from carrying on a business or providing child-related activities in the categories regulated by the Working with Children (Risk Management and Screening) Act 2000. </p>

		<h2>Are there any exemptions?</h2>
		<p>Exemptions from blue card screening apply in relation to certain categories of regulated childrelated employment and business. An	exemption from screening requirements in	relation to one category does not mean that a person will be exempt in relation to another category. For details about any relevant exemptions visit our website. </p>

		<h2>How long does a blue card application take to process?</h2>
		<p>Blue card applications where no police or disciplinary information is received are generally processed within 28 working days provided the form is complete and no further information is	required from the applicant. </p>

		<h2>When can I commence work?</h2>
		<p>Paid employees can commence working while their blue card applications are being processed, but volunteers and people carrying on a business must wait for their blue card to be issued before commencing regulated childrelated work.</p>
		<p>It is important to note that if volunteer and business applicants submit their renewal applications at least 30 days prior to the expiry of their card, they can continue to work while their renewal application is being processed. </p>
		<p>Blue Card Services sends out renewal notices	approximately 10 weeks prior to the expiry of a blue card holder’s card to remind them to submit their application. Organisations employing applicants under these conditions should address potential risks in their risk management strategy</p>
